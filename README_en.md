# Nuntius

[German/Deutsch](README.md)

Nuntius (lat. "messenger" or "message") is a simple ticket printer for OMSI which supports every typical function, e. g. passenger information or selling tickets.

The main focus is on the ease of installation and integration in other busses. Nuntius uses a special "interface script" which allows to easily integrate the printer in a bus while maintaining the communication with other parts like an interior display.

The key features at a glance:

- Login system with driver card and PIN
- Passenger information system with control of matrix and interior displays, as well as announcements (either controlled by hof file or by timetable)
- Ticketing
- Automatic change to "Terminus" or "Break" on the destination displays (configurable via hof file)
- Dark Mode
- Native support of the Krüger++ Matrix (as well as all Krüger based Matrix scripts)

Everything else as well as installation instructions can be found in the ReadMe which is part of the download.
